We present a framework for solving mazes for the robotics lab.

The project contains 3 modules:

- main.py: an example maze solver
- recorder.py: a module for making a pre defined movement actions
- sensing.py: a module for making movement commands according to the environment


We strongly believe that using this framework will allow us to solve the maze with minimal effort.
